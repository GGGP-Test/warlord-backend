This file was created to force Cloud Build to trigger a new build.

Timestamp: 2026-01-08 02:50 UTC+3:30
Purpose: Force webhook to fire and build latest commits

All 5 commits with fresh start changes are on main branch:
- firebase.ts (minimal)
- index.ts (Express only)
- logger.ts (simple logger)
- .dockerignore (faster builds)
- FRESH_START.md (feature guide)

This build should pick them all up and build the Docker image.
