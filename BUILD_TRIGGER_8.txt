# Build trigger #8 - 2026-01-08 03:49 AM +0330
# Simplified deployment using Cloud Run native source-based deploy
# 
# Changes:
# - Removed manual Docker build and push steps
# - Using 'gcloud run deploy --source=.' for automatic build and deploy
# - Cloud Run handles Dockerfile build internally
# - Eliminates Container Registry push permission issues
# - Faster feedback loop with single integrated step
#
# This resolves: "denied: gcr.io repo does not exist. Creating on push requires permission"
# Solution: Cloud Run's native source deployment (no intermediate container registry needed)
