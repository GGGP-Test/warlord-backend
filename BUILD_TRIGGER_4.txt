# Fixed Firebase initialization to use Application Default Credentials
# 
# Changes:
# - Removed dependency on service-account.json file
# - Use ADC (Application Default Credentials) from Cloud Run environment
# - Added proper error handling and logging
# - Project ID loaded from GCP_PROJECT_ID or GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT env vars
#
# This allows the app to start correctly and respond to /health endpoint
