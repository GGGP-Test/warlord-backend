# Build trigger #5 - 2026-01-08 03:40 AM +0330
# Fixed cloudbuild.yaml validation error
# 
# Changes:
# - Removed invalid root-level 'logging' field (was causing build config parse error)
# - Moved 'logging' to proper location under 'options' section
# - Fixed Cloud Run deployment step to use 'gcloud run deploy' instead of 'run' builder
# - Removed unsupported deploy flags
#
# This resolves: "failed unmarshalling build config cloudbuild.yaml: unknown field 'logging'"
