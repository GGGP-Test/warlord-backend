# Fixed npm dependency installation issue
# 
# Changes:
# - Changed 'npm ci' to 'npm install' in Dockerfile (builder stage)
# - Reason: package-lock.json is missing from repository
# - npm ci requires lockfile, npm install works without it
# - Also updated prod stage to use 'npm install --only=production'
#
# This resolves: "The npm ci command can only install with an existing package-lock.json"
