# Build trigger #6 - 2026-01-08 03:41 AM +0330
# Fixed Cloud Build machine type compatibility
# 
# Changes:
# - Changed machineType from 'N1_HIGHCPU_8' to 'E2_HIGHCPU_8'
# - Reason: N1 machines are not available in us-central1 region for Cloud Build
# - E2 is fully compatible and cost-efficient alternative
#
# This resolves: "region does not allow N1 machine types: please use E2 variants"
